NUStudy is an application for managing three kinds of informational material: lecture notes, quizzes and revision tasks.
It helps users to prepare for exams and tests in university by facilitating their learning.

As a developer of NUStudy, this guide can help you understand the basic software architecture and design considerations
for its implementation so that you can start contributing in no time.

For any queries, simply <<ContactUs#, contact us>>.

NOTE: In this document, `monospaced` texts may have different meanings. If the text is in *PascalCase* i.e. first letter
of each word is capitalised, such as `Logic`, then the text is a class or interface name. If the text has a bracket such as `execute("delete 1")`.
Otherwise, the `monospaced` texts are meant for highlighting or user commands depending on the context.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The architecture diagram below gives an overall view of NUStudy's structure. Each component
will be explained in more detail in the coming sections.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for initializing and shutting down the application, linking and cleaning up where necessary.

The `commons` package contains classes used by multiple other components, of which `LogsCenter` is important
as it is used for logging. The rest of NUStudy consists of four primary components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of NUStudy.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds application data in memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads and writes data to disk.

Each of the four components defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the component
and exposes the API using a `{Component Name}Manager` class. For example, the `Logic` component
(see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality
using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== Inter-component interaction

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
issues the command `deletenote 1`.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== `UI`

// tag::UIClassDiagram[]

.Detailed class diagram for `Panels` package
image::PanelPackageClassDiagram.png[]
// end::UIClassDiagram[]

_API:_ link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
`NoteListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract
`UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFX. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

This component

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== `Logic`

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Class diagram of the `Logic` component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

_API:_ link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AppDataParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the sequence diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.
The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker × but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[DeleteSequenceDiagram]]

[[Design-Model]]
=== `Model`
// tag::ModelClassDiagram[]
.Class diagram of the `Model` component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]
// end::ModelClassDiagram[]

_API:_ link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` component is independent of the other three primary components of NUStudy.
It stores application data – notes, questions and revision tasks – as well as a `UserPrefs` object
representing the user's preferences. It also exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Note>` that is bound to the UI,
so any data changes are immediately user-visible.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== `Storage`

.Class diagram of the `Storage` component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

_API:_ link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component reads and writes `UserPrefs` objects and NUStudy data in JSON format.

== Implementation

This section describes some finer details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::lecimage[]
=== Image support for lecture notes

Usually, we do not learn best from just text; we rely on images that our minds can process more easily.
As such, implementing images in lecture notes is a very important feature for NUStudy.

Although some lecture notes have multiple images, it is always possible to combine them using
basic image editing software like the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) and Paint, so the implementation is
limited to at most one image per note. Having a common format for notes facilitates their retrieval through
the `findnote` command and aids a human user in remembering what the notes say.

==== Implementation

Instead of a custom class to represent an image, JavaFX's `scene.image.Image` is used instead.
This is out of necessity, since an `ImageView` is needed to display an image in the GUI and it requires
an `Image` object, not just a `String` path to the image. No significant coupling is introduced
by this choice because `Image` objects can exist without a GUI to display them.

The static method `selectImage()` in `AppUtil` opens up a dialog allowing the user to choose the necessary image.
This is possible because `FileChooser#showOpenDialog()`, which shows the dialog, can be fed an argument of `null`
instead of having to rely on a `Window` object, which is the domain of the `UI` module.

The aforementioned dialog returns `null` if it is closed
without choosing a file (i.e. clicking the close button). We interpret this as "no change"
rather than "no image", i.e. `addnote` and `editnote` proceed as if `i/` was not provided.
If the "no image" interpretation was used, the user who decides to edit a lecture note's image
but then decides not to would be surprised to see the image disappear without warning.
Therefore the value `i/none` has to be explicitly provided in `editnote` to remove the image; `EditNoteDescriptor`
has the field `isImageRemoved` to track this.

We also defer image selection until after the title has been checked against existing lecture notes,
which saves time that would otherwise be wasted in navigating to the desired image.
This is accomplished using three things:

* the `finalizeImage()` method of the `Note` class, calling `selectImage()`
* the `needsImage` field of `Note`, which allows a one-time execution of `finalizeImage()`
* the `isImageReplaced` field of `EditNoteDescriptor`

.Sequence diagram for the execution of `EditNoteCommandParser`
image::ImageSelectionSequenceDiagram.png[]

The diagram above shows how `EditNoteCommandParser` creates an `EditNoteCommand`. It first
creates an `EditNoteDescriptor` to hold details of what changes in the note, setting the new
title (provided by the `t/` argument) and content (`c/`) as necessary. If `i/none` is present,
the `EditNoteDescriptor` is set to remove the image. If `i/` is provided, it is set to replace
the image. An `EditNoteCommand` containing the `EditNoteDescriptor` is finally returned for execution.

Images are only referenced, not embedded, in the JSON file holding application data. These references are
Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) of system files, e.g. `file:data/picture.png`. Since NUStudy is meant to be portable,
we cannot use absolute paths, since they would break when the images are moved or deleted. Instead we copy images
into application data using `finalizeImage()`, which points references to these local copies.
// end::lecimage[]

// tag::lecimagedc[]
==== Design considerations: where to place the image?

* _Alternative 1 (current choice):_ We show the images associated to each and every lecture note
in the first column, together with the title and content.
** Pros: This is easier to implement, for the code interfacing with FXML does not have to be written in places other
than those directly pertaining to notes. It also makes the note "card" (object representing the note)
self-contained.
** Cons: Scrolling through lecture notes, all with images, takes time, but this downside is alleviated
by the `findnote` command.
* _Alternative 2:_ We place *one* full note in the second column and only show a preview (the title and first words
of the content) in the first column.
** Pros: This behaviour is closer to notepad applications on mobile devices which show a list of notes.
It saves space in the list and gives more prominence to a selected note, turning it into a flash card.
** Cons: The second column, normally housing revision tasks, requires extra code to handle the display
of full notes. This may include a separate `NotePreview` class, or `Note` may have a variable toggling
between preview and full modes.

==== Design considerations: when to copy images into the local folder
* _Alternative 1 (current choice):_ We copy images when the command is executed, i.e. in `Command#execute()`.
** Pros: This effects a better separation of concerns – image selection is not execution of the command, while
copying can be a side effect of command execution. Individual command effects can be fine-tuned.
** Cons: Each command that copies images needs to have its own code implementing the copy. To reduce code
duplication, that common code can be written as a method of the `Note` class requiring a `Path` object representing
the destination folder for the copy.
* _Alternative 2:_ We copy images when the image is selected, i.e. in `AppUtil#selectImage()`.
** Pros: Compared to alternative 1, this takes less time between image selection and writing into
application data, minimising the chance of exceptions due to changes in the file system (permissions,
existence of the file at the specified path, etc.) being raised.
** Cons: `selectImage()` has two only loosely related responsibilities in this alternative, which is
a worse separation of concerns. It is impossible to take into account user preferences at the point of image
selection, since it requires a `Model` object which is not available to `AppUtil#selectImage()`.
// end::lecimagedc[]

// tag::questiond[]
=== Question management feature
==== Current implementation

The question management feature is facilitated by `Model`.
The question-related commands extend `Command` with the question object if necessary.
The commands update the `Model` which is implemented by `ModelManager`.
This in turn updates `AppData` which stores all the questions internally as `UniqueQuestionList`.
Local data will be updated in the end by `LogicManager`.
The commands include:

* `AddQuestionCommand` -- Adds a new question to the app.
* `DeleteQuestionCommand` -- Deletes an existing question in the app.
* `ListQuestionCommand` -- Views the list of all questions available.
* `EditQuestionCommand` -- Edits an existing question in the app. (to be implemented)
* `FindQuestionCommand` -- Finds a question with a specified keyword. (to be implemented)

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addQuestion(Question question)`,
`Model#deleteQuestion(Question question)`, `Model#getFilteredQuestionList()` and
`Model#setQuestion(Question target, Question editedQuestion)` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the question mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The app will load all existing information from storage.

Step 2. The user executes `addq q/QUESTION a/ANSWER s/SUBJECT d/DIFFICULTY` command to add a new question to the app.
The `addq` command calls `Model#addQuestion(Question question)`, causing the `AppData` to be updated with the new question.

Step 3. The user executes `deleteq 5` command to delete the 5th question in the app. The `deleteq` command calls `Model#deleteQuestion(Question target)`
and `Model#updateFilteredQuestionList(Predicate<Question> predicate)`, causing the `AppData` to be updated with the
target question removed.

Step 4. The user executes `editq 2 a/NEW_ANSWER` command to edit the answer of the 2nd question in the app.
The `editq` command calls `Model#setQuestion(Question target, Question editedQuestion)` and
`Model#updateFilteredQuestionList(Predicate<Question> predicate)`, causing the `AppData` to be updated with the original
question being replaced by the edited question.

The following sequence diagram shows the interaction between classes when `EditQuestionCommand#execute(model)` is called:

.Sequence diagram for `execute(Model)` of `EditQuestionCommand`
image::EditQuestionCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png[width = "600"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `addq` command:

.Activity diagram for `addq` command
image::AddQuestionActivityDiagram.png[width = "300"]

Question is implemented as a concrete class with its relevant fields consist of `QuestionBody`, `Answer`,
`Subject`, and `Difficulty`.

The following class diagram illustrates how `Question` class is designed:

.Class diagram for `Question`
image::QuestionClassDiagram.png[width = "500"]

===== Design considerations: How `addq`/`deleteq`/`editq` commands execute
* _Alternative 1 (current choice):_ Update the internal storage `UniqueQuestionList` in `AppData` first, then save the updated appData
in local storage when the command finishes executing.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Need the extra step to ensure that the internal list is correctly maintained.
* _Alternative 2:_ Update the local storage directly when the command is executing.
** Pros: No need to implement the internal list.
** Cons: Will access local memory more frequently. May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

===== Design considerations: Data structure to support the question commands
* _Alternative 1 (current choice):_ Use a `UniqueQuestionList` to store questions in `AppData`.
** Pros: Cater to the question model specifically. Question list operations are encapsulated in one class.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated as other models also implement similar list structure.
* _Alternative 2:_ Use Java list to store the questions.
** Pros: Do not need to maintain a separate list class.
** Cons: Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as the model needs to maintain various
list operations.
// end::questiond[]

// tag::quiz[]
=== Quiz mode for revision
==== Implementation

The quiz mode feature is facilitated by `Model`.
The quiz-related commands extend `Command` with specific question object.
The commands update the `Model` which is implemented by `ModelManager`.
This in turn updates `AppData` which stores filtered specific questions internally as `QuizQuestionList`.
Local data will be updated in the end by `LogicManager`.
The commands include:

* `QuizModeCommand` -- Enters the quiz mode with questions selected by user.
* `QuizCheckAnswer` -- Checks the correctness of answer entered by user.
* `QuizShowAnswerCommand` -- Shows the answer for current question.
* `QuizSkipQuestion` -- Skips the current question.
* `QuitQuizModeCommand` -- Quits the quiz mode.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getQuizQuestions(int numOfQuestions, Subject subject
Difficulty difficulty)`, `Model#setQuizQuestionList(ObservableList<Question> quizQuestionList)`,
`Model#showQuizAnswer()`, `Model#getFilteredQuizQuestionList()`, `Model#checkQuizAnswer(Answer answer)`,
`Model#removeOneQuizQuestion()` and `Model#clearQuizQuestionList()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the question mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The app will load all existing information from storage.

Step 2. The user executes `quiz n/NUMBER OF QUESTIONS d/DIFFICULTY s/SUBJECT` command to enter quiz mode of the app.
The `quiz` command calls `Model#getQuizQuestions(int numOfQuestions, Subject subject Difficulty difficulty)` and
`Model#setQuizQuestionList(ObservableList<Question> quizQuestionList)`, causing the `AppData` to be updated with
a list of specific question selected by user for quiz.

Step 3. The user types answer to answer the question. It calls `Model#checkQuizAnswer(Answer answer)` and
`Model#addQuizResult(QuizResult quizResult)`, causing the `AppData` to be updated with the result of the answer.

The following graph explains how `QuizResult` class is designed:

.QuizResultClassDiagram
image::QuizResultClassDiagram.png[]

Step 4. The user executes `show` command to show the answer of current quiz question in the app. The `show` command calls
`Model#showQuizAnswer()`, causing the `AppData` to display the answer on the Ui.

Step 5. The user executes `skip` command to skip the current quiz question in the app. The `skip` command calls
`Model#removeOneQuizQuestion()`, causing the `AppData` to display the next quiz question on the Ui.

Step 6. The user executes `quit` command to exit from the quiz mode. The `quit` command calls
`Model#clearQuizQuestionList()`, causing the `AppData` to clear all quiz question list and return to normal mode.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `quiz` operation works:

.QuizModeSequenceDiagram
image::QuizModeSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command for quiz:

.QuizModeActivityDiagram
image::QuizModeActivityDiagram.png[400, 400]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to store the quiz results
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Update the internal storage `QuizResultList` in `AppData` first, then save the
updated appData in local storage when the command finishes executing.
** Pros: It is easier to implement.
** Cons: It needs the extra step to ensure that the internal list is correctly maintained.
* **Alternative 2:** Update the local storage directly when the command is executing.
** Pros: There is no need to implement the internal list.
** Cons: The access to local memory is more frequent and it may have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

===== Aspect: What data structure is used to support the quiz commands
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `QuizQuestionList` and `QuizResultList` to store data in `AppData`.
** Pros: It is targeted to the quiz model specifically. Quiz question and result list operations are encapsulated in one class.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated as other models also implement similar list structure.
* **Alternative 2:** Use Java list to store the quiz questions and results.
** Pros: There is no need to maintain a separate list class.
** Cons: It violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as the model needs to maintain various
list operations.
// end::quiz[]

// tag::stats[]
=== Statistics feature
==== Implementation

The statistics feature gathers data stored from quizzes done in NUStudy to analyse and return an output.
The different commands supported by the statistics feature are used to filter the type of statistics the user wants.
These commands include:

* `GetQnsCommand` -- Gets all questions answered correctly/incorrectly.
* `GetReportCommand` -- Returns a report of the specified question.
* `GetStatisticsCommand` -- Returns a pie chart containing a break down of the questions by its results.
* `GetOverviewCommand` -- Gets an overview of the types of questions that have been attempted overall.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the statistics mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.
The app will attempt to read past data from any quizzes done and store it internally to a `quizResults` list.

Step 2. The user enters `stats s/CS2103T` to get the statistics of all quiz questions done for CS2103T.
A `GetStatisticsCommand` will be created. When it is executed from the `MainWindow`,
it returns a new `CommandResult` with command type: `STATS`.

The following class diagram shows how the `GetStatisticsCommand` and `CommandResult` classes are related.

.Class diagram for `GetStatisticsCommand`
image::statistics/StatisticsClassDiagram.png[]

Step 3. After `CommandResult` is returned to `MainWindow`, it will call a `showStats` method to
create a pie chart. It will then show a statistics panel, hiding all notes, tasks and questions.

The following sequence diagram shows how the UI handles the `GetStatisticsCommand`:

.UI sequence diagram for `GetStatisticsCommand`
image::statistics/StatisticsSequenceDiagram.png[height = "250"]

Step 4. The user now wants to stop viewing statistics and decides to view all notes, tasks and questions
again using the `listnote` command. The statistics panel will now be hidden.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the statistics command:

.Statistics activity diagram
image::statistics/StatisticsActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Where statistics are shown
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Hide all other panels and only show statistics.
** Pros: Less scrolling will be needed and more information can be shown in one panel.
** Cons: More methods are needed to deal with hiding and showing the different panels leading to more room for errors.
* **Alternative 2:** Allocate a spot in the main window with the notes, tasks and questions for statistics to be displayed.
** Pros: It is easy to implement.
** Cons: The number of notes, tasks and questions that can be seen without scrolling will be decreased.
The charts will be small and condensed making it difficult to see the data at first glance.

===== Aspect: How statistics are represented
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a pie chart.
** Pros: It is easy to read at a glance.
** Cons: Pie chart slices may get too small to see if there are too little correct/incorrect questions done.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a grouped bar chart.
** Pros: The questions done are sorted by subjects, thus it is more informative.
** Cons: As the number of subjects increases, the bars get thinner making it more difficult to see the data.
This is also more difficult to implement.
// end::stats[]

// tag::task_1[]
=== Revision task management
Revision task management involves addition, deletion, editing, searching and many other operations on tasks. This section
explains how task management features are implemented.

==== Implementation

Revision task management is facilitated by `Model`.
Commands related to task manipulation extend `Command` class.
The commands update the `Model` interface which is implemented by `ModelManager` class.
The `ModelManager` then updates `AppData` which stores all the revision tasks in an internal data structure `TaskList`.
`TaskList` is essentially an `ObservableList` of `Task`.
Local data will be updated in the end by `LogicManager`.

//end::task_1[]

The revision task management commands include:

* `AddTaskForNoteCommand` -- Adds a new task for revising note to the app.
* `AddTaskForQuestionCommand` -- Adds a new task for revising question to the app.
* `ClearTaskCommand` -- Clears all tasks in the app.
* `DeleteTaskCommand` -- Deletes a task from the app.
* `DoneTaskCommand` -- Marks a task as done.
* `EditTaskCommand` -- Edits fields of a task.
* `FindTaskCommand` -- Searches for a task with given information.
* `ListAllTaskCommand` -- Displays all tasks to the user.
* `ListDoneTaskTaskCommand` -- Displays tasks that have been done to the user.
* `ListNotDoneTaskCommand` -- Displays tasks that have not been done to the user.
* `ListOverdueTaskCommand` -- Displays tasks that have passed the scheduled time to the user.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addTask(Task task)`, `Model#hasTask(Task task)`, `Model#clearTaskList()`,
`Model#deleteTask(Task target)`, `Model#markTaskAsDone(Task taskDone)`, `Model#setTask(Task target, Task editedTask)`,
`Model#updateFilteredTaskList(Predicate<Task> predicate)` and `Model#getFilteredTaskList()` respectively.

// tag::task_2[]

Taking `AddTaskForNoteCommand` as an example, the following process illustrates the mechanism of adding a revision task for note to the task list (adding a revision task
for question has a similar command but different parameters).

Step 1. The user enters command `rn t/UML diagram dt/01/01/2019 tm/1200` for adding a task for note. The command is parsed by `AddTaskForNoteCommandParser`.
`AddTaskForNoteParser` then creates an `AddTaskForNoteCommand`. The high-level logic of *parsing* and *creating the command*
is similar to the process of deleting a note from the note list as illustrated by the <<DeleteSequenceDiagram, *sequence diagram for deleting a note*>>.
However, the execution stage of `AddTaskForNoteCommand` differs from that of deleting a note.

Step 2. The `Logic Manager` calls `Command#execute(Model)` which essentially calls `AddTaskForNoteCommand#execute(Model)`
because of polymorphism.

Step 3. `AddTaskForNoteCommand` calls its own private method `hasValidNote(Model)` which checks if
the `Note` with `Title` "UML diagram" exists in `Model`. If not, a `CommandException` will be thrown and `execute(Model)` stops because non-existing note
title is not allowed to be the heading of any tasks.

Step 4. `AddTaskForNoteCommand` calls `Model#hasTask(Task)` to check whether the `Model` has a task identical to the one
the user is adding. If there is an existing identical task, a `CommandException` will be thrown and `execute(Model)` stops to avoid duplicate tasks.

Step 5. `AddTaskForNoteCommand` calls `Model#addTask(Task)` to add the new task to the `Model`. `Model` calls
`AppData#addTask(Task)` to add the task to `AppData` which keeps track of all data of the app. `AppData` then calls `TaskList#add(Task)`
to add the task to `TaskList`, which is the underlying data structure storing tasks.

Step 6. A `CommandResult` is created and returned to the `LogicManager` to inform the user of successful addition of a new
task to the revision plan.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between classes when calling `AddTaskForNoteCommand#execute(Model)`.

.Sequence diagram for `execute(Model)` of `AddTaskForNoteCommand`
image::task/AddTaskForNoteCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png[]

Zooming in to *Step 3*, when calling `hasValidNoteForTask(Model)`, `AddTaskForNoteCommand` creates a new `Note` with a `Title` "UML diagram" and a `Content` "dummy entry".
The entry of `Content` is not important because `AddTaskForNoteCommand` only records the `Title` of a `Note` and the existence
of a `Note` is checked against its `Title` only (if the title is in the note list, then the note exists in the list).
The detailed process is illustrated by the sequence diagram below.

.Sequence diagram for checking existence of a `Note` in the model when `AddTaskForNoteCommand` calls its own `hasValidNoteForTask(Model)`
image::task/HasValidNoteSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes the whole process of adding a task for note.

.Activity diagram for adding a task for note
image::task/AddTaskForNoteActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: Design of `Task`
* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** We implement `Task` as a concrete class with two subclasses to support task for
notes and questions respectively.
** Pros: It supports different behaviours of task for `Note` and task for `Question` by polymorphism. The concrete `Task`
class will also allow adding of general tasks in *v2.0*.
** Cons: We need to implement two different `AddTask` commands to support addition of the two different types of tasks.
Hence we need to write more pieces of code.

The class diagram below illustrates how `Task` class is designed:

.Design of `Task` class
image::task/TaskClassDiagram.png[]

* **Alternative 2:** We design `Task` as an interface to be implemented by two different classes.
** Pros: This approach is better in data hiding. The client classes know less information about internal properties of `Task`.
** Cons: We need to implement all methods in the interface and hence more code snippets are needed. Both implementing
classes have to include the field in common such as `isDone`, which results in duplicate code snippets.

* **Alternative 3:** We wrap everything in one concrete `Task` class to support both lecture notes and questions.
** Pros: We need to write less code.
** Cons: It violates the principle of Separation of Concern, making it hard to maintain or extend in the future if more types of
tasks are needed.

===== Aspect: Design of command for adding a task
* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** We implement the command as two independent classes, namely `AddTaskForNoteCommand` and
`AddTaskForQuestionCommand` to support adding `TaskForNote` and `TaskForQuestion` respectively.
** Pros: The two types of commands, although similar in logic, receive different parameters and interact with different
classes (one interacting with `TaskForNote` while another one interacting with `TaskForQuestion`). Therefore, it is better to separate the
concerns by implementing the commands as two separate classes. If `TaskForNote` and `TaskForQuestion` classes deviate more
significantly in the future in terms of their behaviour, this approach makes it easier to maintain the adding commands.
** Cons: We need to write more code. There might be some duplicate code snippets involving the logic shared by both commands.
We also need to implement different parsers for the two commands, which involes some extra work.

* **Alternative 2:** We implement only one class of adding command to support both `TaskForNote` and `TaskForQuestion`.
** Pros: We can write less code as there would be fewer duplicate code snippets and we do not need to implement separate
command parsers.
** Cons: This approach leads to lower level of abstraction as all concerns of `Task`, regardless of `TaskForNote` or `TaskForQuestion`,
are wrapped into the same class. It could be difficult to maintain if the behaviors of `TaskForNote` and `TaskForQuestion`
get more complex and diverse.
// end::task_2[]

=== Logging

We use `java.util.logging` for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (see <<Implementation-Configuration>>).
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)`,
which will log messages according to the specified logging level.

== Non-functional requirements

. Images must be copied into the application data, residing in a dedicated folder,
rather than merely linking to somewhere on the filesystem
. Export format of lecture notes and flash cards must be human-readable text
. Images must be referenced by pathnames with respect to the image folder
. Charts returned by statistics feature must be simple enough that it is universally understood

[appendix]
== Glossary

[[lecture-note]] Lecture note::
An object stored in the application model that includes a title, text content and optionally an image.
It is not quizzable.
// end::nfrglossary[]

[appendix]
== Manual testing
A few ways of manually testing NUStudy are listed below. Of course, any tester
should explore more than just these.

=== Opening and closing
. Initial launch
.. Download the JAR file and copy into an empty folder.
.. Open the jar file. _The GUI with some initial application data should be visible._
. Saving window preferences
.. Change the position and size of the window and close it.
.. Re-launch NUStudy. _It should look just like when it was closed._

=== Image support
. Adding a lecture note with an image
.. Type `addnote t/t c/c i/` in the command line. _An image dialog should be brought up._
.. Select any image. _It should appear in the lecture note panel, as a new lecture note with
title "t" and content "c"._
. Modifying an image
.. After adding one lecture note with an image, type `editnote i i/` where `i` is its index.
.. _The same image dialog should be brought up_; select a different image.
_This image should appear in place of the old image, if any, even if the filename is the same._
. Local copy of images
.. Close the application and move the JAR file and its associated application data to another location.
.. Relaunch the application. _Images should display as before._
. Silent ignoring of broken images
.. Once lecture notes with images have been added, close NUStudy and delete all images
in its data folder.
.. Relaunch the application. _The app should not throw an exception, merely not display any images._
.. Add back the images to the lecture notes using `editnote`. _This operation should succeed._

=== Question management
. Adding a question with all necessary fields
.. Type `addq q/MVC design pattern refers to (  ). a/Model View Controller s/CS2103T d/Medium` in the command line.
.. The application will show the success of adding the question if all fields are present and valid.
. Editing a question
.. Type `editq 1 d/Hard` to change the difficulty of the question at index 1 to hard.
.. The application will show the success of updating the question's difficulty and display all the fields.
The question at index 1 will have a new difficulty of Hard.
. Finding a question
.. Type `findq java python` in the command line.
.. The application will return a list of questions which contain the keyword "java" or "python" in either its
question body or answer. If no question contains these keywords, the application will return an empty list.
. Deleting a question
.. Type `listq` in the command line to view a list of all questions.
.. Type `deleteq 2` in the command line to delete the second question from the list.
.. The application will display the success of deletion of this question and its relevant fields.
The question will be removed from the list.

=== Quiz mode
NOTE: Ensure the application has at least one question to do the quiz.

. Entering the quiz mode
.. Type `quiz n/1 d/easy s/cs2040` in the command line.
.. If the application has the questions which fit the requirement, it will enter the quiz mode and display the quiz questions.
. Answering the question
.. Type your answer in the command line after entering the quiz mode.
.. The result of your answer will be displayed under the command box.
. Showing the answer of the question
.. Type `show` in the command line when the application is in the quiz mode.
.. The correct answer of the current quiz question will be displayed under the command box.
. Skipping current question
.. Type `skip` in the command line when the application is in the quiz mode.
.. The current question will be skipped and the next question will be displayed if there are still available questions.
. Quiting from the quiz mode
.. Type `quit` in the command line when the application is in the quiz mode.
.. The application will exit from the quiz mode and return to the original mode.

=== Getting statistics
NOTE: Ensure that there are some questions in the app and some of them have been answered in quiz mode.

. Getting statistics
.. Type `stats`.
.. The application will display "Here are the statistics:".
All notes, tasks and questions will be hidden, a panel containing a pie chart will appear.
. Getting questions
.. Type `question -c`.
.. The application will display "Here are the correct questions:".
All notes, tasks and questions will be hidden, a panel containing a pie chart and a
list of all correct quiz results will appear.
. Getting report
.. Type `report 1`.
.. The application will display "Here is a report of question 1:".
All notes, tasks and questions will be hidden, a panel containing a pie chart and
all quiz results for question 1 will appear.
. Getting overview
.. Type `overview`.
.. The application will display "Here is an overview of the questions:".
All notes, tasks and questions will be hidden, a panel containing a stack bar chart will appear.

=== Revision task management
. Before adding task
.. Add some notes to the app to be used for tasks.
.. Add notes by typing `addnote t/a c/a`, followed by `addnote t/b c/b`.
. Adding a task for revising a note to the revision list
.. Type `rn t/a dt/01/11/2019 tm/0900`.
.. The app will display message for successful addition of the task if there is a note with title "a" in the note list.
. Adding a task for revising a question to the revision list
.. Type `rq i/1 dt/12/09/2019 tm/1200`.
.. The app will display message for successful addition of the task if there is a question with index 1 in the question list.
If the question list is empty, an error message will be shown.
. Editing a task
.. Type `redit 1 h/b`.
.. The heading of the first task will be changed to b if both the first task and a note with title "b" exist in the note list.
. Marking a task as done
.. Type `rdone 1`
.. The first task will be marked as done.
. Searching for a task
.. Type `rfind tm/0900`.
.. All task at 9am will be shown (if existing).
. Listing all tasks
.. Type `rlist`.
.. All tasks will be shown.
. Showing finished tasks
.. Type `finished`.
.. All finished (done) tasks will be shown.
.. Similar operations can be done for unfinished tasks and overdue tasks with command `unfinished`, `overdue` respectively.
. Deleting a task
.. Type `rlist` to display all tasks for better demo effect. (If there are more than one tasks in the current list view, you can skip this step)
.. Type `rdelete 2`
.. The second task in the current list view will be successfully deleted (if existing).
. Clearing all tasks
.. Type `rclear`.
.. All tasks will be cleared.
.. Type `rlist` and you can see no task is left in the list.
