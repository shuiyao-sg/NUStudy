By: `AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4`      Since: `September 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction

NUStudy is an application for managing three kinds of informational material:
lecture notes, quizzes and revision tasks. Their primary purpose is preparing for exams
and tests in universities, but they can also be useful for refreshing memory,
particularly after a module has ended (the reliance of some computing modules
on prior knowledge is rather heavy).

Most of the work is done through a command line; the GUI merely displays
the results. The overall appearance is similar to a simple note-taking client.

== Quickstart

.  Ensure you have Java 11+ installed.
.  Download the latest `nustudy.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the application's home folder.
.  Double-click the file to start the app (if this does not work, use `java -jar nustudy.jar`).
The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. Some commands you can try are
* `listnote`: lists all lecture notes
* `addnote t/Title c/Content`: adds a lecture note with title "Title" and content "Content".
* `deletenote 1`: deletes the first lecture note
* `help`: open the help window
* `exit`: exits the app

[[Features]]
== Features

This section helps you navigate through the features and commands.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPERCASE` are parameters you supply e.g. in `addnote t/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter
which can be used as `addnote t/TITLE`. Parameters can be provided in any order; in the case of
multiple parameters with the same prefix (e.g. `addnote t/A t/B`) the last one is taken (`B`)
unless otherwise stated.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used zero or more times.

=== Lecture notes

==== Adding lecture notes: `addnote`
This is the basic command for getting your lecture notes into NUStudy. The `i/` field, if provided, brings up a
dialog where you can choose an image from your computer's file system; such an image will be displayed at the
bottom of the note. +
Format: `addnote t/TITLE c/CONTENT [i/]`

Suppose you want to remember what the order-7 triangular tiling looks like and its Schläfli symbol.
Type `addnote t/Order-7 triangular tiling c/{3,7} i/` into the command line. The file selection dialog
will pop up, and you can select the image from your file system. Once done, you will see the lecture note:

image::screenshots/addnote.png[]

It is fine to back out of the image selection dialog; an image can always be added later using `editnote`.
Your images are copied into the application's data folder, so don't worry about losing them –
you can always take them along. Images resize according to the window, but if an image is small enough that it can fit at its
natural resolution, it is left that way.

==== Editing lecture notes: `editnote`
If your lecture notes need updating, use this command, providing arguments `t/`, `c/` and `i/` (at least one)
as you would do with `addnote`, but only those arguments you want to change. Providing `i/` brings up the same image
selection dialog like in `addnote`.

Images can explain a lot, but if you want to remove them, use `i/none` in your command, and the dialog
will not appear. Otherwise, if you back off from choosing an image (e.g. by clicking the dialog's
close button), nothing will happen and your images will remain safe and sound.

Multiple notes can share the same image, and you can overwrite existing images currently
in NUStudy with new ones sharing the same filename.

The index must be between 1 and the number of lecture notes inclusive. It is listed before the title of
each lecture note:

image::screenshots/index.png[]

Format: `editnote INDEX [t/TITLE] [c/CONTENT] [i/[none]]`

==== Viewing lecture notes: `findnote`
Of course, what use are virtual lecture notes if you can't search through them? This command
displays those notes whose titles contain any one of the words (space-separated, ignoring case) you provide
as arguments. +
Format: `findnote WORD [WORD]…`

==== Listing all lecture notes: `listnote`
This is like running `findnote` but with no arguments. It shows all your lecture notes in their unabashed glory. +
Format: `listnote`

==== Deleting lecture notes: `deletenote`
When your semester ends, surely you want to free up space on your computer so you can accept new notes
for the coming semester? This command deletes the lecture note with the index you provide. +
Format: `deletenote INDEX`

==== Clearing all lecture notes: `clearnote`
Finally, if you ever find a better application than NUStudy for your lecture notes, you can clear
them all. Your quiz questions and revision tasks will not be affected. +
Format: `clearnote`
// end::lecnote[]

// tag::question[]
=== Questions

NUStudy can also store different sets of questions and answers;
at your command, the system will prompt you to answer those questions.

==== Adding Questions: `addq`

You can add a question and its answer together with the necessary fields to the app. +
Format: `addq q/QUESTION a/ANSWER s/SUBJECT d/DIFFICULTY`

****
* You can define any type of difficulty level that is customized to your understanding of the question.
****

Example:

* `addq q/How to represent 85 in binary? a/1010101 s/CS2100 d/medium`

.Add question command
image::questionCommandsDemo/addqcommand.png[width = "600"]

The new question will be added to your question bank.

.Result for add question command
image::questionCommandsDemo/addqresult.png[width = "600"]

==== Editing a question: `editq`

You can edit the fields of an existing question by providing the fields you want to change. +
Format: `editq INDEX [q/QUESTION] [a/ANSWER] [d/DIFFICULTY] [s/SUBJECT]`

****
* Edits the question at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed
question list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****

Examples:

* `editq 6 a/16 d/easy`

.Edit question command
image::questionCommandsDemo/editqcommand.png[width = "600"]

Edits the answer and difficulty of the 2nd question to be `16` and `easy` respectively.

.Result for edit question command
image::questionCommandsDemo/editqresult.png[width = "600"]

==== Locating questions by keyword: `findq`

This command will give you a list of questions whose body or answer contains the keyword(s) you specified. +
Format: `findq KEYWORD [MORE KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive.
* The order of the keywords does not matter.
* Only full words will be matched.
* NUStudy will return a list of questions containing any one of the keywords you provided.
For example, if you type the command `findq word1 word2`, questions with body or answer which contains
"word1", "word2", "word 1 word2", "word2 word1", or "word1 word2 xxxxxx yyyy".
****

Examples:

* `findq coupling tcp`

.Find question command
image::questionCommandsDemo/findqcommand.png[width = "600"]

Finds the questions whose body or answer contains the keyword `coupling` or `tcp`.

.Result for find question command

// end::question[]

==== Deleting a question: `deleteq`

You can delete a question at its specified INDEX together with its relevant fields from the list. +
Format: `deleteq INDEX`

****
* Deletes the question at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed question list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Example:

* `listq` +
`deleteq 3`

Deletes the 2nd question from the question list.

* `findq character` +
`deleteq 1`

Deletes the 1st question in the results of `findq` command.

==== Listing all questions: `listq`

This command allows you to view the list of all questions. +

// end::quiz[]

// tag::statistics[]
=== Statistics
After doing some quizzes, you can get statistics of the questions that you have done in the app.
The statistics functions listed below are used to filter the type of statistics that you want to get.

NOTE: To close any statistics panel, you can simply type any of the commands from the Lecture notes,
Questions and Revision tasks features. E.g. `rlist`.

NOTE: Quiz results stored in the app are not synchronised with the questions.
If you have modified a question using the `editq` command,
the stored quiz result will still refer to the original question.
This is because a question that has been modified might cause past
answers to become irrelevant and distort the statistics.

==== Getting statistics for subjects : `stats`
You can get a breakdown of the questions that you have done by its results.
If you want to narrow the results down, you can also choose to get the statistics for a difficulty
level by adding `d/` or get the statistics of different subjects by adding `s/`. +
Format: `stats [d/DIFFICULTY] [s/SUBJECT1] [s/SUBJECT2]...`

Example: +
Let's say you have answered some questions from CS2103T previously and would like
a ballpark figure to estimate how well you have grasp the basic foundations of the subject.

To get this figure:

. Type `stats d/easy s/cs2103t` into the command box, and press `Enter` to execute it.
. The result box will display the message "Here are the statistics: [easy] [cs2103t]"
. And you can see a pie chart of the number of correctly and incorrectly answered questions.

.The result of `stats d/easy s/cs2103t` command
image::statistics/stats.PNG[600, 600]

==== Getting questions with correct/incorrect answers: `question`
You can get all questions that have been answered correctly/incorrectly by using `-c/-i` respectively.
Either one of `-c` or `-i` must be used. You can also filter by subjects by adding `s/`. +
Format: `question [-c] [-i] [s/SUBJECT1] [s/SUBJECT2]...`

Example: +
Now that you have gotten the number of correct to incorrect answers, you want to see what questions
you have done incorrectly to decide on how you can further improve.

To see the questions:

. Type `question -i s/cs2103t` into the command box, and press `Enter` to execute it.
. The result box will display the message "Here are the incorrect questions for [cs2103t]:"
. You will be able to see a list of all your incorrectly answered questions for CS2103T and
your past answers to it as well as a breakdown of the number of questions by difficulty level.

.The result of `question -i s/cs2103t`
image::statistics/question.PNG[600, 600]

==== Getting a report of individual questions: `report`
You can get a report of how well you have answered a particular question
and see all your past answers to the question. +
Format: `report INDEX`

****
* The index refers to the question number in the displayed question list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Example: +
After getting the questions that you have done wrong, you noticed that there is one particular
question that you have answered incorrectly numerous times. This just so happened to be the seventh
question in the question list. You decided to investigate further.

To see a report of the question 7:

. Type `report 7` into the command box, and press `Enter` to execute it.
. The result box will display the message "Here is a report of question 7:"
. And you can see all your attempts at the question as well as a pie chart of your results.

.The result of `report 7` command
image::statistics/report.PNG[600, 600]

==== Getting overview of questions attempted: `overview`
You can get an overview of the types of questions that you have attempted overall.
A panel containing a stacked bar graph, sorted by subjects will be returned.
You can also add two `dt/` fields representing a time period to get questions you did
within that time period. The format for date is dd/MM/yyyy. +
Format: `overview [dt/START_DATE dt/END_DATE]`

NOTE: For date input constraints, you may refer to <<Adding a revision task for a note: `rn`>>.

NOTE: If you have more than 8 different difficulty levels, the stack bar chart may repeat
colors for the difficulties. To differentiate between the different bars in the chart,
you can use your mouse to hover above them.

Example: +
You are finally done viewing your quiz results and want to know what questions you should attempt next.
To be a well-rounded individual, you decided to check if you have been neglecting any subjects recently.

To see an overview of your results:

. Type `overview dt/20/10/2019 dt/06/11/2019` into the command box, and press `Enter` to execute it.
. The result box will display the message "Here is an overview of the questions: (20/10/2019 to 06/11/2019)"
. And you can see a stack bar chart of all questions that you have attempted from 20/10/2019 to 06/11/2019.

.The result of `overview dt/20/10/2019 dt/06/11/2019` command
image::statistics/overview.PNG[600, 600]
// end::statistics[]

// tag::task_1[]
=== Revision tasks

You will know more about how to work with revision tasks in this section. The revision tasks help you plan your revision of notes
and questions. You can do various operations on tasks, including addition, deletion, searching etc.

The revision tasks are not synchronised with the note or the question. Once created, the task content will not
change if you modify the corresponding note or question. +
Revision tasks with the same heading, date *and* time are considered duplicate tasks and cannot co-exist.

// end::task_1[]

The diagram below shows how a revision task looks like:

image::UserGuideRes/TaskUI.png[600, 600]

// tag::task_2[]

==== Adding a revision task for a note: `rn`
You can add a revision task for a note to the current revision task list with this command.
The heading will copy the title.
The GUI will display all tasks upon completing the command. +
Format: `rn t/TITLE_OF_NOTE dt/DATE tm/TIME` +

NOTE: `TITLE_OF_NOTE` is case sensitive.

Example: +

1. Type `rn t/CS2103T UML diagram dt/01/11/2019 tm/0900` in the command input box, and press `Enter` to execute it, as
shown in the diagram below.
+
image::UserGuideRes/TaskCommands/AddTaskForNote_command.png[600, 600]
+
2. The result box will display the message "Revision task added: [N] NOTE : CS2103T UML diagram by: 01 November 2019 09:00".
The task is added to the task list shown in the middle panel, as shown in the diagram below.
+
image::UserGuideRes/TaskCommands/AddTaskForNote_success.png[600, 600]
+

// end::task_2[]

====

*Constraints for `DATE` (yyyy : `YEAR`, MM : `MONTH`, dd : `DAY`), `TIME` (HH : `HOUR` , mm : `MINUTE`) input:*

* All numerical inputs must be integers.
* `DATE` input format should follow Singapore local date convention (i.e. dd/MM/yyyy).
* `YEAR` is 4-digit, 0000 < yyyy < 9999. `MONTH` is 2-digit, 00 < MM < 13. `DAY` is 2-digit, 00 < dd < 32.
* `HOUR` is 2-digit and follows 24-hour format, -01 < HH < 24. `MINUTE` is 2-digit, -01 < mm < 60.
* "2400" and "0000" for `TIME` are both valid and represent 12am on the same day.

NOTE: Some days of month are valid for some months but invalid for others, eg. *31* is invalid for February, April,
June, September, November; *30* is invalid for February; *29* is invalid for February in common years. But they are valid
for other scenarios. The day of month will automatically run down to the last valid day of that month in case you remember
the number of days of a month wrongly.

====

// tag::task_3[]

==== Adding a revision task for a question: `rq`
You can add a revision task for a question to the current revision task list with this command.
The heading will copy the question body.
The GUI will display all tasks upon completing the command. +
Format: `rq i/INDEX_OF_QUESTION dt/DATE tm/TIME` +
Example: +
`rq i/1 dt/11/11/2019 tm/1500`

NOTE: For constraints on `DATE` and `TIME` input, you may refer to <<Adding a revision task for a note: `rn`>>.

==== Removing revision task: `rdelete`
You can remove a particular revision task from current list with this command.
The GUI will display the current list (all-task, done-task, not-done-task or overdue-task) view. +
Format: `rdelete INDEX_OF_TASK` +
Example: `rdelete 2` +

// end::task_3[]

Detailed steps: +

1. Type `rdelete 2` in the command input box, and press `Enter` to execute it. You can refer to the diagram below for a visual guide.


+
image::UserGuideRes/TaskCommands/DeleteTaskCommand.png[600, 600]
+

2. The result box will display the message "Deleted task: ..." with the task details. The deleted task will be removed from the task list, as shown by the diagram below.

+
image::UserGuideRes/TaskCommands/DeleteTaskCommand_success.png[600, 600]
+

// tag::task_4[]

==== Marking the revision task as done: `rdone`
You can mark a task as done once you finished it.
The GUI will display the current list (all-task, done-task, not-done-task or overdue-task) view. +
Format: `rdone INDEX` +

Example: +

1. Type `rdone 1` in the command input box, and press `Enter` to execute it, as shown by the diagram below.
+
image::UserGuideRes/TaskCommands/DoneTaskCommand.png[600, 600]
+
2. The result box will display the message "Revision task marked as done: [Y] ..." with the task details. The status icon
of the task turns from "[N]" (not done) to "[Y]" (done). You may refer to the diagram below.
+
image::UserGuideRes/TaskCommands/DoneTaskCommand_success.png[600, 600]
+

NOTE: You cannot use "undone" (marking a task as not done) feature.
People usually "undone" a task because they realise that some parts of the task are not fully completed. In this case, you
should create a new task with a new date or time (same as "re-scheduling" in the real world).

==== Editing a revision task: `redit`
You can edit a revision task with this command. You need to provide non-empty arguments with prefix `h/`, `dt/` and `tm/`
for fields you want to change. Please take note that *at least one field* must be provided. +
Format: `redit INDEX [h/HEADING] [dt/DATE] [tm/TIME]` +
Example: +
`redit 1 h/CS2100 Logic Circuit dt/15/08/2019 tm/1200`

NOTE: `HEADING` can be the title of a note or the question body of a question.
The edited `HEADING` must be an existing title or question body. +
`HEADING` is case sensitive.

==== Viewing all revision tasks: `rlist`
You may view the whole revision task list using this command. +
Format: `rlist`

==== Viewing completed revision tasks: `finished`
You may use this command to view the list of revision tasks that you have completed. +
Format: `finished`

==== Viewing uncompleted revision task: `unfinished`
You may use this command to the list of revision tasks that you have not completed. +
Format: `unfinished`

==== Viewing overdue revision tasks: `overdue`
You may use this command to view the revision tasks which you have not done but having passed the scheduled time. +
Format: `overdue`

==== Finding tasks with specified details: `rfind`
You may use this command to search for tasks with specified details. You may key in keyword(s) of the heading, or the date, or the time,
with prefix `h/` `dt/` `tm/` respectively.
The GUI will display a task list of all tasks with the field (heading or date or time) that matches your input. +
Format:
`rfind h/WORD [WORD]...` or `rfind dt/DATE` or `rfind tm/TIME`

NOTE: Words for headings are case insensitive for `rfind`.

Example: +
`rfind h/hello world` - This command gives you all tasks with headings containing "hello" or "world" or "hello world". +
`rfind dt/01/11/2019` - This command gives you all tasks on 1 November 2019. +
`rfind tm/1200` - This command gives you all tasks at 12:00 (12pm), regardless of date.

NOTE: The priority of the fields are `h/` > `dt/` > `tm/`. When multiple prefixes (fields) are provided for search, only
the field with the highest priority will be considered. The rest will be ignored.

NOTE: A heading is considered matching with the keywords as long as one of the words in the heading is the same as one of the words in the input keywords.
Please note that the minimum matching unit is a word (*not characters*) in the heading. Words in the headings are separated by a space. +

//end::task_4[]

====
For example, suppose we have a task list with tasks of headings {"hello", "hello?", "Hello", "helloworld", "hello world", "HelloWorld"},
here are the use cases:
[width="90%",cols="30%,50%",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Input `WORD`|Tasks shown

|hello|{"hello", "Hello", "hello world"}
|hello?|{"hello?"}
|helloworld|{"helloworld", "HelloWorld"}
|hello world|{"hello", "Hello", "hello world"}
|he|No task shown
|=======================================================================
