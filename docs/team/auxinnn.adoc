== Introduction

This portfolio is used to showcase my contribution to the CS2103T project in National University of Singapore. There
are five students in our group, all majoring in Computer Science. We are given a task to enhance a desktop application
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[Address book 3] with JavaFX GUI. It supports the command line
interface for use input. We decided to morph it into a study management application called NUStudy which is targeted to
university students. NUStudy is used to manage students' lecture notes, test questions and revision tasks. It also
allows students to do mock quiz and view the statistics of the results for better revision.

This is the interface of our project：

I am responsible for designing and writing codes for quiz feature. The following sections will describe my contributions
to the feature and relevant documentations in detail.

Here are some explanations of the icons and formatting used in this portfolio：

****
* A highlighted `monospace` implies that this is a command that can be inputted and executed by the application.
* _Italics_ implies a component, class or object in the architecture of the application.
* The pull requests and issues are represented by a # and its number (e.g. #1)

NOTE: This symbol indicates that the following information is important.

== Summary of contributions

This section briefly describes my contributions to the implementation of quiz feature and other helpful contributions to
the group.

*Enhancement added:* I added the quiz feature of the application (Starting from
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/36[#36])

* What it does: This feature allows the users to do a mock quiz. The `quiz` command allows the users to enter the quiz
mode of the application. Users can type answer on command line and the correctness will be checked to show the result.
The result of each quiz will be stored as _QuizResult_ and used to support the report feature.

* Justification:  The `quiz` command will randomly select questions from the database according to the difficulty and
subject specified by users and stored in _QuizQuestionList_. It will act like an actual online quiz which the question
will be displayed one at a time and users need to type answer to receive the feedback from the application to know
whether it is correct or wrong.

* Highlights: This feature cooperates with another feature implemented by my teammate. The result of each question from
the quiz will be stored and my teammate will use it for report feature. The implementation was tricky in the beginning
on how to override the question panel and displaying quiz questions one after another. I solve it by using a boolean
to set the _QuestionListPanel_ in the _MainWindow_ class and adding a list containing one quiz question in
_QuizQuestionList_ class to display question one by one(https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/49[#49]
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/70[#70]
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/76[#76]).

*Code contributed:* You may review the report of my code contribution to the project https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=Auxinnn&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Auxinnn&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[here].

*Other contributions:*

* Basic design of Question feature:
** During the development of quiz feature, I helped to design a basic model of question feature so that my teammate
could refer to the template for modification and further development (https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/39[#39]).
* Implement Quiz Result to support report feature:
** I designed and implemented the basic architecture of quiz result so that my teammate could use it to support the
report feature (https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/53[#53]
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/74[#74]).
* Identify problems in application for other teams:
** I helped to discover some of the bugs in the application for another team so that they can fix them and improve the
quality of the product (https://github.com/Auxinnn/ped/issues/2[#2]
https://github.com/Auxinnn/ped/issues/6[#6]).

== User guide contributions

We have modified the User Guide of Address Book to demonstrate the commands of our project. The following part shows my
contribution to the *NUStudy User Guide* for quiz feature.

== Developer guide contributions

We also modified the Developer Guide so that the style and architecture fit our project. The following part shows my
contribution to the *NUStudy Developer Guide* for quiz feature.

NOTE: In this sections, `monospace` indicates user command, class objects and methods.
