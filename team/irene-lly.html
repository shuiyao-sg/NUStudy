<div class="paragraph">
<p>This portfolio documents my contributions to NUStudy, a learning application.
Our team of 5 software engineering students from the National University of Singapore (NUS)
were asked to enhance an Addressbook application with Command Line Interface (CLI)
as the primary mode of input as part of our Software Engineering project in CS2103T.
We had to conceptualize and implement enhancements to the existing Addressbook application
and do it in a manner such that future developers can continue working on it.
After some deliberation, we decided to morph it into an application to facilitate learning for students.
The morphed application, NUStudy, enables students to add and manage notes;
test their knowledge with questions that they have added;
get statistics of how well they have answered these questions;
and set tasks to plan their revision schedule.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I contributed to this project by implementing the statistics feature as documented below.
In particular, I have implemented the <code>stats</code>, <code>question</code>, <code>report</code> and <code>overview</code> commands.
The following sections will elaborate more on these enhancements
and showcase some documentations that I have added to the user and developer guides in
relation to these enhancements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Key to symbols and formatting used:<br>
<code>stats</code>: A grey highlight indicates that this is a command that can be inputted
into the command line and executed by the application.<br>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section shows the enhancements I have added to the project as well as my other contributions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Enhancement added</strong>: I added the ability to get statistics of the questions done in the quizzes.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The different commands allow users to filter the quiz results
and return an overview of how well they have done the questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: The <code>question</code> and <code>report</code> commands help users to get an
idea of what subjects they are weaker in and see the common mistakes that they have made.
The <code>stats</code> and <code>overview</code> commands gives users an idea of which questions they
should attempt more of and what subjects they have been neglecting.
Overall, the statistics feature helps to provide users with a rough
outline of their progress in mastering the subject.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.
An in-depth analysis of design alternatives is required in the future.
The implementation was also challenging as it required many changes to existing models,
logic classes and the UI.</p>

Quiz results stored in the app are not synchronised with the questions.
If you have modified a question using the <code>editq</code> command,
the stored quiz result will still refer to the original question.
This is because a question that has been modified might cause past
answers to become irrelevant and distort the statistics.

<p>The statistics feature gathers data stored from quizzes done in NUStudy to analyse and return an output.
The different commands supported by the statistics feature are used to filter the type of statistics the user wants.
These commands include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>GetQnsCommand</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Gets all questions answered correctly/incorrectly.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenario and how the statistics mechanism behaves at each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1. The user launches the application.
The app will attempt to read past data from any quizzes done and store it internally to a <code>quizResults</code> list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2. The user enters <code>stats s/CS2103T</code> to get the statistics of all quiz questions done for CS2103T.
A <code>GetStatisticsCommand</code> will be created. When it is executed from the <code>MainWindow</code>,
it returns a new <code>CommandResult</code> with command type: <code>STATS</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following class diagram shows how the <code>GetStatisticsCommand</code> and <code>CommandResult</code> classes are related.</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 5. Class diagram for <code>GetStatisticsCommand</code></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3. After <code>CommandResult</code> is returned to <code>MainWindow</code>, it will call a <code>showStats</code> method to
create a pie chart. It will then show a statistics panel, hiding all notes, tasks and questions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sequence diagram shows how the UI handles the <code>GetStatisticsCommand</code>:</p>

<p>Step 4. The user now wants to stop viewing statistics and decides to view all notes, tasks and questions
again using the <code>listnote</code> command. The statistics panel will now be hidden.</p>
