<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of the CS2103 Software Engineering module at the National University of Singapore,
I was part of a team of five tasked to develop an application from <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3">a given Java
address book application</a>, which will be called AB3 in the rest of the portfolio.
We chose to morph it into NUStudy, an application for
managing lecture notes, questions and revision tasks&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;all three things pertinent to the
average university student, regardless of location. Like the original, it has a command line
as its main method of interaction and a JavaFX GUI for display. It has around 5000 lines of code
and looks like this:</p>

<p>This portfolio showcases my contributions to NUStudy: implementing the lecture notes by
retooling the existing <em>Person</em> class, related documentation in the user and developer guides
and management of the Git repository surrounding NUStudy. It also showcases my technical writing skills
and my ability to explain complicated enhancements or modifications to the uninitiated person.</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-contributions"><a class="link" href="#summary-of-contributions">Summary of contributions</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a brief description of my contributions to NUStudy – to code, documentation
and project management. These contributions show my ability to not only write good code,
but also manage and synthesise team members' varying output into a coherent whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I was responsible for <strong>implementing lecture notes</strong> (starting from <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/34">#34</a>).
These are simple items with a title, some content and optionally an image. For this I modified the existing
<em>Person</em> class in the original address book application and its associated commands (<em>AddCommand</em>, <em>EditCommand</em>, etc.)&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I did not have to make any new classes.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecture notes are the primary source of a student&#8217;s acquired knowledge in university, yet they come in many formats.
Having a unified appearance helps the student understand the content of lecture notes better, by removing
unnecessary markup and distracting styles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While adding this feature I also refactored all other code throughout the application to use names relevant to
lecture notes. This helped my teammates add their own features, setting an example for them to follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Image support was implemented starting from <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/67">#67</a>. Instead of a custom class,
I used JavaFX&#8217;s <em>scene.image.Image</em>, which reduced the additional code I had to write on top of the
<em>Title</em> and <em>Content</em> classes by avoiding an unnecessary wrapper.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>As my fellow team members added their features to the code, one of the constructors of <em>CommandResult</em>
grew to have four boolean variables representing command side effects. In <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/71">#71</a>
I replaced the boolean arguments of this constructor with a single integer argument acting as a bit field.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This serves two purposes: to avoid unnecessary use of the boolean literals and to allow easy extension
to more side effects by increasing the range of the integer argument.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>I enforced a style for the user and developer guides and wrote several of their key sections,
such as the user guide&#8217;s introduction and the developer guide&#8217;s non-functional requirements.
See <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/21">#21</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/22">#22</a>
for examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In v1.4 I improved the graphical user interface in response to bugs filed by other people
(<a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/148">#148</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was the <strong>lead integrator</strong> for NUStudy:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Managed all four releases (v1.1 to v1.4) on GitHub</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up Travis and Netlify for the project, enabling continuous integration and previews of documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resolved merge conflicts for teammates' pull requests (see <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-4/main/pull/44">#44</a> for an example)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I contributed to <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/forum">forum</a> discussions, both as a receiver

<p>Our application&#8217;s user guide had to be updated with the new features we added in code.
The sections below are what I wrote for my features, demonstrating my ability to write
clear, concise end-user documentation.</p>

<h4 id="adding-lecture-notes-code-addnote-code"><a class="link" href="#adding-lecture-notes-code-addnote-code">Adding lecture notes: <code>addnote</code></a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the basic command for getting your lecture notes into NUStudy. The <code>i/</code> field, if provided, brings up a
dialog where you can choose an image from your computer&#8217;s file system; such an image will be displayed at the
bottom of the note.<br>
Format: <code>addnote t/TITLE c/CONTENT [i/]</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose you want to remember what the order-7 triangular tiling looks like and its Schläfli symbol.
Type <code>addnote t/Order-7 triangular tiling c/{3,7} i/</code> into the command line. The file selection dialog
will pop up, and you can select the image from your file system. Once done, you will see the lecture note:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/screenshots/addnote.png" alt="addnote">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is fine to back out of the image selection dialog; an image can always be added later using <code>editnote</code>.
Your images are copied into the application&#8217;s data folder, so don&#8217;t worry about losing them –
you can always take them along. Images resize according to the window, but if an image is small enough that it can fit at its
natural resolution, it is left that way.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="editing-lecture-notes-code-editnote-code"><a class="link" href="#editing-lecture-notes-code-editnote-code">Editing lecture notes: <code>editnote</code></a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your lecture notes need updating, use this command, providing arguments <code>t/</code>, <code>c/</code> and <code>i/</code> (at least one)
as you would do with <code>addnote</code>, but only those arguments you want to change. Providing <code>i/</code> brings up the same image
selection dialog like in <code>addnote</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Images can explain a lot, but if you want to remove them, use <code>i/none</code> in your command, and the dialog
will not appear. Otherwise, if you back off from choosing an image (e.g. by clicking the dialog&#8217;s
close button), nothing will happen and your images will remain safe and sound.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multiple notes can share the same image, and you can overwrite existing images currently
in NUStudy with new ones sharing the same filename.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The index must be between 1 and the number of lecture notes inclusive. It is listed before the title of
each lecture note:</p>

displays those notes whose titles contain any one of the words (space-separated, ignoring case) you provide

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like other projects in CS2103, there is the expectation that future developers could
build on NUStudy. Thus we also updated the developer guide; below are my principal contributions to it,
showcasing three aspects: my ability to write technical documentation, the complexity of what
I contributed in code and my proficiency in using diagrams to explain my work.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="image-support-for-lecture-notes"><a class="link" href="#image-support-for-lecture-notes">Image support for lecture notes</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually, we do not learn best from just text; we rely on images that our minds can process more easily.
As such, implementing images in lecture notes is a very important feature for NUStudy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although some lecture notes have multiple images, it is always possible to combine them using
basic image editing software like the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) and Paint, so the implementation is
limited to at most one image per note. Having a common format for notes facilitates their retrieval through
the <code>findnote</code> command and aids a human user in remembering what the notes say.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="implementation"><a class="link" href="#implementation">Implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of a custom class to represent an image, JavaFX&#8217;s <code>scene.image.Image</code> is used instead.
This is out of necessity, since an <code>ImageView</code> is needed to display an image in the GUI and it requires
an <code>Image</code> object, not just a <code>String</code> path to the image. No significant coupling is introduced
by this choice because <code>Image</code> objects can exist without a GUI to display them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The static method <code>selectImage()</code> in <code>AppUtil</code> opens up a dialog allowing the user to choose the necessary image.
This is possible because <code>FileChooser#showOpenDialog()</code>, which shows the dialog, can be fed an argument of <code>null</code>
instead of having to rely on a <code>Window</code> object, which is the domain of the <code>UI</code> module.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The aforementioned dialog returns <code>null</code> if it is closed
without choosing a file (i.e. clicking the close button). We interpret this as "no change"
rather than "no image", i.e. <code>addnote</code> and <code>editnote</code> proceed as if <code>i/</code> was not provided.
If the "no image" interpretation was used, the user who decides to edit a lecture note&#8217;s image
but then decides not to would be surprised to see the image disappear without warning.
Therefore the value <code>i/none</code> has to be explicitly provided in <code>editnote</code> to remove the image; <code>EditNoteDescriptor</code>
has the field <code>isImageRemoved</code> to track this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also defer image selection until after the title has been checked against existing lecture notes,
which saves time that would otherwise be wasted in navigating to the desired image.
This is accomplished using three things:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the <code>finalizeImage()</code> method of the <code>Note</code> class, calling <code>selectImage()</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the <code>needsImage</code> field of <code>Note</code>, which allows a one-time execution of <code>finalizeImage()</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the <code>isImageReplaced</code> field of <code>EditNoteDescriptor</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/ImageSelectionSequenceDiagram.png" alt="ImageSelectionSequenceDiagram">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. Sequence diagram for the execution of <code>EditNoteCommandParser</code></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The diagram above shows how <code>EditNoteCommandParser</code> creates an <code>EditNoteCommand</code>. It first
creates an <code>EditNoteDescriptor</code> to hold details of what changes in the note, setting the new
title (provided by the <code>t/</code> argument) and content (<code>c/</code>) as necessary. If <code>i/none</code> is present,
the <code>EditNoteDescriptor</code> is set to remove the image. If <code>i/</code> is provided, it is set to replace
the image. An <code>EditNoteCommand</code> containing the <code>EditNoteDescriptor</code> is finally returned for execution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Images are only referenced, not embedded, in the JSON file holding application data. These references are
Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) of system files, e.g. <code>file:data/picture.png</code>. Since NUStudy is meant to be portable,
we cannot use absolute paths, since they would break when the images are moved or deleted. Instead we copy images
into application data using <code>finalizeImage()</code>, which points references to these local copies.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both the use of a JavaFX built-in object for images and the system-dependent implementation of
graphical objects required me to make certain critical decisions regarding image support in lecture notes.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="design-considerations-where-to-place-the-image"><a class="link" href="#design-considerations-where-to-place-the-image">Design considerations: where to place the image?</a></h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Alternative 1 (current choice):</em> We show the images associated to each and every lecture note
in the first column, together with the title and content.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: This is easier to implement, for the code interfacing with FXML does not have to be written in places other
than those directly pertaining to notes. It also makes the note "card" (object representing the note)
self-contained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Scrolling through lecture notes, all with images, takes time, but this downside is alleviated
by the <code>findnote</code> command.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Alternative 2:</em> We place <strong>one</strong> full note in the second column and only show a preview (the title and first words
of the content) in the first column.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: This behaviour is closer to notepad applications on mobile devices which show a list of notes.
It saves space in the list and gives more prominence to a selected note, turning it into a flash card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: The second column, normally housing revision tasks, requires extra code to handle the display
of full notes. This may include a separate <code>NotePreview</code> class, or <code>Note</code> may have a variable toggling
between preview and full modes.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="design-considerations-when-to-copy-images-into-the-local-folder"><a class="link" href="#design-considerations-when-to-copy-images-into-the-local-folder">Design considerations: when to copy images into the local folder</a></h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Alternative 1 (current choice):</em> We copy images when the command is executed, i.e. in <code>Command#execute()</code>.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: This effects a better separation of concerns – image selection is not execution of the command, while
copying can be a side effect of command execution. Individual command effects can be fine-tuned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Each command that copies images needs to have its own code implementing the copy. To reduce code
duplication, that common code can be written as a method of the <code>Note</code> class requiring a <code>Path</code> object representing
the destination folder for the copy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Alternative 2:</em> We copy images when the image is selected, i.e. in <code>AppUtil#selectImage()</code>.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Compared to alternative 1, this takes less time between image selection and writing into
application data, minimising the chance of exceptions due to changes in the file system (permissions,
existence of the file at the specified path, etc.) being raised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: <code>selectImage()</code> has two only loosely related responsibilities in this alternative, which is
a worse separation of concerns. It is impossible to take into account user preferences at the point of image
selection, since it requires a <code>Model</code> object which is not available to <code>AppUtil#selectImage()</code>.</p>
